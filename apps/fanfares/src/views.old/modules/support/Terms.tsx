          representations with respect to Third-Party Links. You use all Third-Party Links at your own risk, and should
          apply a suitable level of caution and discretion in doing so. When you click on any of the Third-Party Links,
          the applicable third party’s terms and policies apply, including the third party’s privacy and data gathering
          practices. You should make whatever investigation you feel necessary or appropriate before proceeding with any

          are otherwise legally entitled to do so. You are legally responsible for the Content you submit to the
          Services.

        <li>
          <strong className="ml-12">• Rights You Grant.</strong> You retain all of your ownership rights in your
          Content. In short, what belongs to you stays yours. However, we do require you to grant certain rights to

        <li>
          <strong className="ml-12">• Licence to Excalibur.</strong> By providing Content to the Services, you hereby

          promoting and providing the Services, including making your Content available to other users; (ii) improving
          the Services; and (iii) and monitoring and analysing Content usage of the Services in order to derive and

        <li>
          <strong className="ml-12">• Licence to other Users. </strong>You also hereby grant each user of the Services a

        <li>
          <strong className="ml-12">• Duration of Licence.</strong> The licences granted by you continue until the
          Content is removed as described below. Once removed, the licences will terminate, except where the operation
          of the Services, use of Content permitted before your removal, or the law requires otherwise. For example,
          removal of Content by you does not require Excalibur to: (a) recall Content that is being used by other users
          within any limited offline viewing functionality of the Service; or (b) delete copies we reasonably need to
          keep for legal purposes.

        </li>
        <li>
          <strong className="ml-12">• Removal of Content by Excalibur.</strong> If we reasonably believe that any of
          your Content (1) is in breach of this Agreement, or (2) may cause harm to Excalibur, our users, or third
          parties, we reserve the right to remove or take down some or all of such Content. We will notify you with the
          reason for our action unless we reasonably believe that to do so: (a) would violate the law or the direction
          of a legal enforcement authority, or would otherwise risk legal liability for Excalibur; (b) would compromise
          an investigation or the integrity or operation of the Services; or (c) would cause harm to any user, other
