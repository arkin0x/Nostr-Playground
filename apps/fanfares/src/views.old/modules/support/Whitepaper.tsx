        <p className="mt-4">
          As we embark on the digital age, we are seeing huge changes in the way we live our lives. The internet is a
          revolution in terms of how we communicate with each other and in terms of how we buy things. Media is becoming
          more interactive and more on-demand as consumers are being given more choice than ever before. Advances in
          digital media production equipment have meant that the cost of producing and distributing content is lower
          than ever. More content is being created than ever before and creators can reach a larger audience than ever
          in history. Ironically though, it sometimes seems to some of us that the quality of content is lower than it
          has ever been. There is so much content out there vying for everyone’s attention using ever more creative ways
          to make you look at their content.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4">
          In the days when TV and Radio were being broadcast using the analogue system, there was a limited bandwidth in
          which to play the content. To maintain just three channels of terrestrial television (for a limited number of
          hours per day) in the UK, entire teams of people were required. An editor had a high degree of control over
          which content was being broadcast. In the early days of the internet, we dreamed that this new innovation
          would lead to a democratisation of media as everyone could create and broadcast their message to the masses.
          In reality though, it seems that media is more controlled than ever as just a few monopoly platforms deliver
          the content to the masses. Consumers now expect to get content for ‘free’ and at first glance it seems that we
          are not paying. The big media platforms do get paid though, when they act as middlemen, harvesting and selling
          our data to advertisers. They are not getting paid by the consumer directly, but by the advertisers. We are
          not really getting content for free, we are paying for it in the goods and services that we chose to buy.
          Products and services have the cost of advertising built into the price.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4">
          As profit maximising businesses, the platforms are incentivised to promote content that makes them and their
          shareholders the most money. The content that generated the highest profits will be the content that generates
          the highest advertising revenue. In the modern world of digital delivery every piece of content can be tracked
          and information can be stored and aggregated. That information can be used to promote the highest revenue
          generating content to users of the platform. That is the Web 2 algorithm.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4">
          Centralisation of media distribution has occurred with the Web 2 model. The network effects of the internet
          have generated a tendency towards natural monopolies. Return on investment for advertisers is higher on a
          platform where there is more information stored about the users of that platform. This is because an
          advertiser can more effectively target the users with ads that the computer modelling tells them will work on
          people with a particular set of characteristics. Smaller sites with less customer information will not be able
          to allow such targeting and will prove to be less profitable for an advertiser. The end result is that most
          advertising revenue goes to the biggest platforms with the most data and they will be the only ones that will
          survive.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4">
          The value in a platform like Facebook or Tik Tok is not in the computer application but in the people that
          post, comment, like and share. The work is done by them as the creators and the promoters of content. The
          money made by the platform goes to the shareholders. There is no incentive for the shareholders to respect the
          users data.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4">
          VC funding has been the mechanism for getting the big tech companies off the ground. Capital investment
          enabled platforms to advertise in order to gain users quickly and become the natural monopoly. The Web 3 model
          needs little capital for marketing as the users are the promoters of a good platform with good content.

          An Alternative Monetisation Model
        </Heading>
        <p className="mt-4">
          The monetization model that web 2 has built seems to be a little less than ideal. The question is how do we
          fix it?
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4">
          It looks like the first piece of the puzzle is already in place, we have a money system for the internet.
          Bitcoin is an internet native currency, decentralised and controlled by no single entity. Operated on a peer
          to peer basis, it is open for everyone to use and it is an immutable record of transactions which means that
          it is the best store of value that we have ever had. The more recent development of the lightning network
          offers a payment system that sits on top of bitcoin. This gives us instant payments that are virtually free of
          charge, to anyone in the world.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4">
          Solana is a blockchain built based on the blueprint of the bitcoin model. It offers fast low cost
          transactions, but also it offers smart contract technology. Smart contract technology is being used to
          register media files on the blockchain using Non Fungible Tokens (NFTs). This could be the beginning of
          something big as this technology allows someone to own an item of media in their own wallet. Buying songs on
          Itunes or audiobooks on Audible does not really grant ownership to the purchaser. Their access to that digital
          content is entirely dependent on the existence of that third party application. An NFT held on decentralised
          storage can give access to that content forever.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4">
          When someone chooses to pay for something, they are effectively voting for the continued production of that
          good, or service. A dataset can be created that records the number of times that all the items were consumed
          and the number of times that people chose to pay, then that data could be used to curate quality.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4">
          Many of us find that the best recommendations we get for media content come from other people. Excalibur would
          be using the aggregated information that came from the payment ‘votes’ of all the people that consumed the
          content, to take a poll of what are the best quality experiences.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4">
          Excalibur data can be made open and anonymous which would make it possible for anyone to build applications on
          top of it. The first application might be to simply rank the content that has the highest amount paid for each
          item. That should be a good indicator of quality. One would assume that a consumer wanting to pay for
          something that they were given for free would be a reliable identifier of good quality. They may have been
          motivated to pay because they felt that they had learned something, been entertained or given a new
          perspective on something by the creator.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4">
          More sophisticated applications could allow the consumer to make the choice to share some of their personal
          data in an encrypted way. The ranking of content could take into account their preferences in combination with
          the overall score of successful payments expressed by the wider audience. They could receive a list of
          recommendations that would be a balance between their personal preferences and aggregated votes of money paid
          by the wider audience.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4">
          All of this would be in contrast to existing platforms that deliver content. They are looking at the total
          number of views. This number can be increased by spending a lot of money on the marketing of the content
          rather than the quality of the content itself.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4">
          Machine learning systems use ‘big data’ to define probabilistic models. These models can suggest the
          likelihood of certain things happening. If your aim was to find content that would be most likely to lead to a
          consumer purchase, then you might create a system that monitors the successful ‘click throughs’. A platform
          might have millions of videos on it and based on the results of the big data analysis, they could rank the
          videos in terms of ‘average’ money spent during and shortly after each video is watched. Logically, the most
          promoted videos should be the ones that score highest in terms of money spent. These will be the ones that are
          generating the most advertising revenue for the platform and so promoting these videos will lead towards the
          goal of profit maximisation. Companies such as Facebook have discovered that this is not the most popular
          method of monetization for the consumer. Perhaps a more palatable option would be to have the consumers think
          that it is in fact the personal information (as opposed to click throughs) that is being used to recommend the
          content.. It is worth noting that Google and Facebook don’t reveal the rules of the algorithms that they
          employ to recommend content to us. In reality, they probably are using the consumer’s personal data to target
          them, but not in the sense that they might think. They are using your data to measure the effect of different
          types of content. If they find that a certain type of content makes you more susceptible to advertising, then
          they can promote that content to people with a similar data profile as you. For example, if you are someone
          that likes cats, then they know from their data analysis that people that like cats are 5 times more likely to
          click on an ad after watching a cat video. In that case you are going to get a lot of cat videos promoted to
          you.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4">
          What we are proposing here in terms of consumer feedback through monetisation, would turn the system upside
          down. It would take us from one where the companies are telling the consumers what is good quality, to one
          where the consumers are telling the companies what is good quality. The consumers should be telling the
          producers what to produce and the way that consumers achieve that power is by paying for content. Paying for
          something creates a market place, a voting system where the consumers are collectively identifying quality.
          This is preferable to a system that tells the consumer what to buy as giving them the power to do that will
          undoubtedly lead to them selling you the thing that is cheapest to produce. In this scenario they may try to
          make you think that the product is better than the thing you really wanted. These are profit maximising
          entities after all.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4">
          Enter the Decentralised Broadcasting Network (DBN). This is an enterprise where human intelligence is an
          integral part of the operation. The consumers in a DBN are effectively a market research collective. They
          receive content for free and they are given the option to pay for it. Consumer choices collectively indicate
          the most desirable goods and services, from the selection that is being presented to them. Their decision to
          pay acts as a vote of confidence for the producer and at the same time their decision to pay is funding future
          production. Consumers become nodes in a Human Intelligence Network (HIN), where they become part of the
          production process. Furthermore, they have the option to become the marketers and distributors, as they choose
          to share the very highest quality content with their own network. These networked curators, investors,
          marketers and distributors of content will get paid for their work.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4">
          We all perhaps have a sense that the financial system is broken and it appears that there is no way to fix it.
          How can anyone compete with the big tech monopolies when they have so much data on all of us? How could anyone
          expect to be able to start something that could compete? Why would anyone pay for something that they could do
          for free?
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4">
          The answer is in the blueprint that was given to us in the ‘Bitcoin White Paper’ Satoshi Nakamoto, 2008. The
          Bitcoin system rewards early entrants to the network with digital assets that are integral to the functioning
          of the network. The work that is being done by the nodes on the network provides security and integrity. A DBN
          operates on a similar basis, giving digital assets to the people that do the work of producing, curating,
          marketing, distributing and investing in content. The early entrants to the network earn more digital assets
          as they have taken a risk on an uncertain future. The early bitcoin miners in 2009 who got a lot of bitcoin
          for using a small amount of electricity on a home PC. Early adopters of a DBN will earn a large amount of
          Excal tokens for the work that they do in building the network. Selecting and broadcasting quality media will
          lead to programmatically distributed rewards.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4">
          This is a proof of work system, as the only way to earn the Excal tokens is to do the work. It is a network
          that will be created by the people and for the people. It would operate in a very different way to the profit
          maximising corporations that currently rule the internet. Instagram, at its core, is a computer application.
          The real value in instagram is in the network of people that post, like and share the content, but almost all
          of the money that is generated by that platform goes to the shareholders that own Facebook stock. There is an
          opportunity for a system to be created where the owners of the network are the people that do the work.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4">
          A DBN takes out the middleman and allows creators to connect with their audience directly. It allows their
          audience to become the rulers of their own media as they choose what they want to see.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4">
          The issuance of digital assets by the system is one way by which workers will get paid. But in the early days,
          few will recognize the true value of the tokens and they will want to get paid in a currency that is more
          readily spendable. People that participate in the network will get a share of the solana and bitcoin tokens
          paid by the consumers. A referral scheme will use smart contracts to reward people for sharing quality content
          with their contacts.

        <Heading className="mt-4 text-lg font-bold leading-10 text-white md:text-2xl xl:text-3xl">Tokenomics </Heading>

        <p className="mt-4">The tokens will be of two types: </p>
        <p className="mt-4">
          Media tokens in the form of NFTs or SFTs, that are specific to individual items of media distributed by the
          network. People that find new content early will earn these tokens when they donate and distribute. Ownership
          will grant the donor access to an exclusive chat room where they can communicate with the creator and other
          like minded people that chose to commit their funds. In that exclusive chat room, the donor might discuss
          ideas for future episodes by the creator. The process is crowdfunding of content and also a crowdsourcing of
          ideas.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4">
          Monetary tokens (or Excal tokens as we call them on Excalibur) will be issued to the network participants in a
          similar way to how bitcoins are awarded to miners in the network. People that search out good new content and
          share it with the network like a human version of bitcoin miners. They are spending their time searching
          through hundreds of new pieces of content, many of which they will have to discard. If they find a few good
          bits of content and share them with the network, then they will be rewarded in a similar way to which a
          bitcoin miner is rewarded for finding a very unique hash of the previous block.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4">
          As the network gains momentum, the amount of content uploaded to the network will increase. The intelligence
          that is generated regarding the quality of the content will have a value.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4">
          In the early days the people that use Excalibur will be the creators that upload content to it and the people
          that distribute the content to their networks. Together these people will be ‘the creator economy’. They are
          creating, reviewing and consuming each other&apos;s content. Over time their work should generate a distilled
          stream of quality content that will likely be the very best of all the content uploaded. Consumers from
          outside the creator economy will want to access that quality stream. In order to gain access they will have
          the option to buy the Excal tokens from the creator economy that do the work to produce and curate the high
          quality content. The early adopters that built that creator economy from the ground up will have the
          opportunity to be more highly rewarded for their efforts. Just like the early bitcoin miners in 2009 were
          running the mining software on their home PCs and generated a lot of bitcoin for a small investment of
          electricity.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4">
          Our initial focus will be podcasters whose content is crypto related. Their audience will find it easier than
          most to pay for the content because they are more likely to have a wallet with some Solana or Bitcoin in it.
          Also, their audience is likely to understand the concept of Excalibur as a Web 3 project. They will likely see
          it stand out as a crypto project that is most likely to succeed. Many crypto enthusiasts will likely want to
          know how they can become part of the project and benefit from the upside. Podcasters have the opportunity to
          achieve engagement from their audience if they talk a bit about Excalibur in their podcast. They can let
          people know that they can’t buy Excal tokens, but they can earn them by sharing the content. This will be
          effective promotion for both the podcaster and for the excalibur platform.

          The Excalibur Incentive System
        </Heading>
        <p className="mt-4">
          Excalibur as a platform will be focusing on podcast content initially, and it will enable podcasters to
          connect directly with their audience. Direct monetization for the creators is possible through peer-to-peer
          broadcasting, as can become nodes in the network and earn affiliate income. Blockchain technology is used to
          enable listeners to buy a digital membership card that gives them access to an exclusive chat room.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4 font-bold">How does Excalibur work?</p>
        <p className="mt-4">
          Podcasters upload their content to Excalibur and the platform generates a link that they will send directly to
          their audience. Clicking on the link will take the audience to a page where they will listen to the podcast.
          While they listen, they can connect their crypto wallet or enter their credit card details and donate to the
          creators. The content itself is open source, so that can listen for free. If they choose to join the community
          of people by crowdfunding, then they are promoting the production of future podcasts.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4 font-bold">The Community</p>
        <p className="mt-4">
          The exclusive community of members can speak with other like minded people that were sufficiently interested
          in the content to pay for it. The podcaster can build community by including a message in the podcast to the
          audience. They can tell them about the opportunity to become a member and crowdfund the production.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4">The Network Effect</p>
        <p className="mt-4">
          The community of listeners are incentivized to become broadcasters by allowing them to generate a unique link
          to the podcast that will include their crypto wallet in the future revenue stream. They can earn an income by
          distributing podcasts to people whom they think will appreciate the content. The Blockchain rewards people in
          the network for the work that they are doing in growing the audience for the podcaster. Smart contracts enable
          the revenue to be automatically split between the creators and the network of broadcasters. This is Web 3, no
          legal contracts are required, no accounts department, no invoicing and no chasing people for money.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4 font-bold">The incentives</p> <p className="mt-4"></p>
        <p className="mt-4">Supporting future production</p>
        <p className="mt-4">
          A key incentive for a listener to choose to pay for a podcast, will be the pleasure of knowing that they are
          supporting future episodes from one of their favourite podcasters. There is an additional benefit, as this
          process functions a little like a kickstarter project, where the consumer that wants the proposed product to
          exist, will vote with their money by ‘pre-ordering’. Those that do pay, can add their contact details to a
          mailing list and have future content sent directly to them, getting early access to the new podcasts and
          having the opportunity to be the first to forward it onto their network.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4 font-bold">Mint an NFT of the podcast</p>
        <p className="mt-4">
          Two types of consumer are granted the privilege of minting an NFT, those that pay for a podcast and those that
          send it to someone else that chooses to pay for it. They are either funding the creator directly or they are
          doing so indirectly by growing the network of consumers and funders. Either way this will earn them the right
          to mint an NFT as a souvenir of the podcast. The thumbnail picture will stay in their wallet forever and when
          they click on it they can listen to the podcast again.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4">
          The NFT will give them access to an exclusive chat room where they can speak directly with the creator as well
          as to like minded consumers that have also chosen to pay for the content.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4 font-bold">Affiliate Income</p>
        <p className="mt-4">
          Consumers that like a podcast and want to share it can generate an affiliate link. That is a new URL which has
          the same content, but new payment information. Payments generated from that affiliate link will include the
          wallet of the affiliate in the smart contract for revenue sharing. They are doing the job of expanding the
          network for the creator and so they get paid 50% of any revenue that comes from their distribution. They also
          get 25% of the next round of payments when people in their network become affiliates themselves. This second
          round distribution reward means that affiliates are incentivized to get the content into the hands of an
          influencer who has millions of followers.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4">
          Consumers don’t strictly have to pay for content in order to become affiliates, but by doing so they can be
          added to the creator’s mailing list for early distribution and that will enhance their earnings power by
          giving them more chances to be the first to send it out to people that haven’t heard it before.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4 font-bold">Micropayments</p>
        <p className="mt-4">
          Blockchains enable low cost fast secure payments on a peer to peer basis. Excalibur is utilising Solana and
          Bitcoin Lightning to enable micropayments with a transaction fee of a fraction of 1 cent. Traditional payment
          systems like Visa and Mastercard charge a minimum of 20 cents transaction fee and often quite a lot more than
          that.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4">
          The ability to make small payments for individual items of media means that it is possible to crowdfund
          content in a way that we have never done before. The amount of money that a podcaster earns from distributing
          through Spotify or YouTube is incredibly low. Even when they put advertising into their content they are still
          earning small amounts of money each time a consumer consumes the content. Rates for some platforms are shown
          in the table below:
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4">
          Podcasters can send an early distribution of their content to their mailing list of fans. This can be a
          version of the podcast that doesn’t contain the advertising interruptions that it normally would. Within that
          context they can describe the concept of Excalibur and ask their consumers to make a small payment to fund
          future production. In many ways Bitcoin was a kickstarter project for a new peer to peer payment system.
          Excalibur builds on top of that concept by being a kickstarter project for a new peer to peer crowdfunded
          media distribution system.

      <Heading className="mt-4 text-xl font-bold leading-10 text-white md:text-2xl xl:text-3xl">Excal Tokens</Heading>

      <p className="mt-4">
        The Excal tokens will be distributed to members of the community for the work that they are doing to promote
        quality content and to expand the size of the network. The pool of Excal tokens will be split 50/50 between
        discretionary and algorithmic distribution.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-4">
        The launch of the Excal token on the platform will happen after a critical mass of podcasts and listeners are on
        the platform. This is in order to prevent bad actors from attempting to manipulate the distribution system.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-4 font-bold">Discretionary Token Distribution</p>
      <p className="mt-4">
        The core developers of the Excalibur platform will receive some of the Excal tokens for their work.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-4">
        Community developers will be able to contribute code that will be added to the system when it is approved by the
        network. A voting system will be created whereby the community can propose and validate additions to the system.
        Rewards can be made from the treasury on the basis of the community votes. Partners of the project that are able
        to provide introductions or who contribute to growth of the application in a specific way will be rewarded with
        Excel tokens on a discretionary basis.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-4">
        Early podcasters that upload their content to the platform will be rewarded with Excel tokens. They can tell
        their audience that they are sending an episode of the podcast specifically out to them with no advertising or
        product placements in it. They can still publish that content in all of the usual places and add the adverts in
        as they wish. We will distribute Excal tokens to them on a discretionary basis as they are helping to build the
        Excalibur audience, just as we are helping them to build theirs.
      </p>

      <p className="mt-4">
        At some point it is envisaged that the growth of the platform will have reached sufficient momentum for the
        discretionary incentives (to join the project) to come to an end. At that point, the decisions on the future
        direction of the Excalibur project will be handed over to the votes of the participants within the network. From
        then on, the voters will be the individuals who will have an interest in the continued success of Excalibur.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-4 font-bold">Algorithmic Distribution</p>
      <p className="mt-4">
        Once there are a sufficient number of podcasters on the platform, a formal lunch date of the platform will be
        set. From then on the other 50% of the total pool of tokens will be distributed to the network. This is the
        means by which the platform will become truly decentralised, as more of the tokens are issued, there will be no
        one person or group of people that will control the system.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-4">
        0.0006% of the remaining coins will be issued to the network on any given day. The actual number of coins issued
        each day will decline in the form of a geometric curve in order that the early adopters are rewarded for being
        pioneers by risking their time and effort on a project that does not have a certain future. This model is based
        on the blueprint of the Bitcoin incentive system where the early adopters of bitcoin mining earned huge numbers
        of bitcoins for using a small amount of electricity in running the brute force algorithm to secure the network.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-4">
        The share of the day’s issuance that goes to any one wallet is determined by the amount donated by their
        affiliates on a pro rata basis. This means that the incentive is to find or produce content that you think is of
        high quality and to distribute that content to people whom you think will value it enough to pay for it. A
        podcaster earns tokens by creating good content and sending it out to their audience and a curator earns tokens
        by spending time seeking out the new content that is of high value and forwarding it to their network as an
        affiliate link. The work that creators and curators do on the network is akin to bitcoin mining as they are
        incentivized to broadcast good quality content to people whom they think will appreciate it. Many people find
        that the best recommendations for media that people receive come from other people. The real potential of this
        application is to offer an alternative to the artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms with a superior system of
        a human intelligence (HI) network.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-4">
        Over a 60 year time period the distribution of Excal tokens will decline down to zero and the network will
        become funded solely by the affiliate fees that they earn for broadcasting to their network. This is again based
        on the Bitcoin methodology, where the miners will eventually be earning just transaction fees for processing of
        new blocks.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-4 font-bold">Proof of Diligence</p>
      <p className="mt-4">
        We will build a blockchain that contains all the transactions that happen between wallets within a payment and
        distribution network. There is a record of every transaction that has ever been made. The ledger can be used to
        assess the level of discernment for each wallet in the network. Wallets that pay for content early in the chain
        will be effectively voting with their money for that content. If that content goes on to be a success in
        attracting payments from many other consumers then the early sponsors can be said to have exercised good
        diligence. Each wallet will have a verifiable success ratio in terms of how many items they paid for in total
        versus the number that went on to be a success. In any weighting system that aims to deliver the best quality
        content to consumers, the opinions of the owners of the successful wallets should be given higher value with
        regards to the value of content uploaded in the future.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-4">
        The intelligence that is gathered by the network as to which content has been most highly rated by people in the
        community has a value. There will be a Green Room where customers can go to find the best content and they will
        pay to access using Excal tokens. They will be able to enter search terms that narrow the selection down to
        their specific area of interest, but the results that appear will be driven by the votes of payments that have
        been made by the network. This Green Room can evolve into a metaverse where each room represents a different
        category of content.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-4">
        Google was a revolution in internet search in the early 2000s because they found a way to use backlinks to
        create a more powerful search engine with a better set of search results than any other search engine at the
        time. Excalibur is the web 3 equivalent of Google. The Human Intelligence Network that we are creating is a
        complete loop of a creator economy
      </p>
      <p className="mt-4 font-bold">
        The longer term plan is to get enough content on to the platform so that the Green Room becomes a place of real
        value. The creator community operates as a creator economy upvoting each other´s content and the crowd adds
        value by selecting and sharing the content that they value most. A place to go to get the best content
        recommended to you the Green Room will start to have a value if access is restricted to people who can pay with
        Excal tokens. This would be a completion of the full circle of a creator economy. It would give natural value to
        the Excal tokens that have been earned through the proof of human work protocol.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-4">
        At some point, people who do not create and do not have time to search for good content may want to benefit from
        the output of the Human Intelligence Network that is Excalibur. Those people will have no Excal tokens and so
        they will have to pay in fiat money for the service that the Excalibur community is providing. Namely the work
        of creating, sorting and ranking of content so that cash rich time poor people can find the best content. The
        community could vote with their Excal tokens on what is to be done with the shared bank account that the fiat
        money goes into.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-4 font-bold">Further Applications</p>
      <p className="mt-4">
        Blockchain technology has proven to be very powerful in facilitating the crowd funding of startup projects.
        Billions have been raised by individuals all around the world without the need for intermediaries, brokers or
        traditional fundraising organisations. The main problem so far though has been the tendency for the projects
        that have been raised money to have turned out to be complete scams. There was a total lack of due diligence
        being done by the investors. Many people were investing in projects that they didn’t understand. The majority
        were inexperienced investors that didn’t know how to critique an investment proposal or how to check the
        validity of the claims being made by the entrepreneurs. Moreover, there was no way of controlling the investment
        once the funds had been invested. The entrepreneurs were not held accountable in terms of delivery on their
        promises and there were no checks on how the funds were being spent.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-4">
        The Proof of Diligence system being developed here can be used to provide a decentralised consensus of the
        viability of a startup proposal. A greater weighting can be given to the votes of the individuals who have
        demonstrated good judgement in the past. New investors may want to have their funds distributed on the basis of
        consensus weighted to the wallets that have proof of diligence. By investing alongside people that have a proven
        track record, people can get higher returns without having to do the work themselves. Investors would probably
        be willing to pay a fee to people with a credible track record if that gives them access to quality deal flow.
        This is a form of decentralised fund management which could lead to very fast and efficient funding for good
        media projects.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-4">
        Blockchain payments are programable, so the timing of the release of the funds can be based on achieving clearly
        defined milestones. This can be the basis of a governance structure that keeps the entrepreneurs accountable to
        the investors.
