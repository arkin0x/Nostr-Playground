        Excalibur ia a Web 3 Audio Platform where the customer has the chance to buy a ticket to the afterparty by
        contributing to the creator of the podcast. The ticket is a collectible asset that they can keep forever. The
        afterparty that they get access to is a gated chat room where they can speak to other people that liked the
        podcast enough to pay for it. Also, they can potentially speak to the creator and engage in brainstorming for
        ideas of what to include in the next episode.

        Excalibur operates as a decentralized distribution system where content is delivered on a peer to peer basis.
        Consumers of content have the opportunity to become affiliate broadcasters or promoters of content that they
        consider to be of value to others. This works with a Patreon style donation system where the consumer has an
        opportunity to pay on the same platform as the content is being delivered. Affiliate payments can be managed
        through smart contract technology whereby crypto payments are automatically split between creators and
        promoters.

        Excalibur DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) is owned and controlled by the people that build the
        network. They are the creators that publish on the platform and the people that do the work of finding and
        distributing the best quality content. Excalibur enables creators to cut out the middleman and connect directly
        with their audience. Monetisation is possible through peer-to-peer payments using Solana. The payment
        opportunity is available on the same page as where the podcast is being listened to.

          As a Web3 creator economy, Excalibur incentivises a better quality curation of media. Members of the network
          can earn Excal tokens by contributing to the community in one of four ways:
        </Text>
        <li className="ml-12 mt-4">1- Create content that people who will appreciate it enough to make a donation.</li>
        <li className="ml-12">
          2- Promote the content on Excalibur to people who will appreciate it enough to make a donation.
        </li>
        <li className="ml-12">
          3- Develop new technical features for Excalibur that are deemed valuable by the community of Excalibur DAO
        </li>
        <li className="ml-12">
          4- Partner with Excalibur to promote the project and receive a discretionary distribution of Excal tokens by
          agreement with the Excalibur DAO
        </li>
      </ol>
      <Text className="mt-8 block text-base font-normal">
        For creators, the incentive is to create the best quality content that they possibly can. They are incentivized
        to avoid ‘click bait’ that grabs people’s attention in the short term, as consumers will not be willing to pay
        for that. Greater rewards will come from really good quality that inspires, educates, entertains and energizes
        the audience.
      </Text>
      <ol>
        <Text className="mt-8 block text-base font-normal">
          For promoters, the incentive is to find the best content uploaded, share it with people whom they think will
          appreciate it and encourage them to make a donation. There are five reasons to make a donation:
        </Text>
        <li className="ml-12 mt-4">
          1- Support the creator and fund the future production of content (aka Kickstarter)
        </li>
        <li className="ml-12">2- Mint an NFT of the content that you can own in your wallet forever</li>
        <li className="ml-12">
          3- Use the NFT to gain access to a gated chat room where you can communicate directly with the creator and
          other like minded people that chose to donate.
        </li>
        <li className="ml-12">4- Become a part of future production by offering ideas and feedback.</li>
        <li className="ml-12">
          5- Potentially become a guest on a podcast with the creator where you can discuss your ideas.
        </li>

        Excalibur is a creator economy. Together we create a place where people can go to find a curation of the very
        best content available. In the early stages, creators and promoters will be the people most active in the
        community and they will be creating and promoting to each other. Their donations will be a form of peer review
        system as the content that receives the most donations will get the highest ratings. As the project gains
        momentum and there is more content available, there will be a Green Room where a curation of the very best
        content will be presented. That content will be determined by the total amount donated and by the ratio of
        donations to views. Donations act as votes for the best content in a way that is far more powerful than a ‘like’
        or an ‘upvote’ that is given away for free.
      </Text>
      <Text className="mt-8 block text-base font-normal">
        The Green Room is exclusively accessible to those that have Excal tokens. Over time, people from outside the
        creator economy will want to access the Green Room. People from within the creator economy will be able to
        supply Excal tokens to the wider world. These may initially be gifted to friends, but a free supply will not be
        unlimited.

          Excalibur is both a proof of work and a proof of stake system. The proof of work system in Excalibur is based
          on the work done by humans to find and promote good quality content and build the network. The work done
          within Excalibur that expands the network will be rewarded with Excal tokens. The Excal tokens that people
          have acquired represent a stake in Excalibur which is the sum total of the work that has been done in the
          past. That stake gives control over the future of Excalibur. Excal tokens have three functions:
        </Text>
        <li className="ml-12 mt-4">
          1- Currency - The investment of time and effort made by members of the Excalibur network will give them
          ownership of the currency that flows through the system
        </li>
        <li className="ml-12">
          2- Governance - Token holders are the DAO, they can vote on key decisions that affect the future of the
          community. People that have done the work to build the network are the people that control the project and
          determine its future direction.{' '}
        </li>
        <li className="ml-12">
          3- Security of the network - Excal token holders will have a greater weight in the process of determining
          which content is recommended to the end user of Excalibur as a content delivery system.{' '}
        </li>
      </ol>
      <Text className="mt-8 block text-base font-normal">
        Token distribution will be 50% on a discretionary basis to the developer community and partners. The other 50%
        will be programmatically distributed to the community of creators and promoters.
      </Text>
      <Text className="mt-8 block text-base font-normal">
        The distribution system is based on the model of Bitcoin issued to Bitcoin miners. Early adopters will receive
        more tokens for any given amount of work than people who join at a later date when the platform is established.
        The geometric curve of token distribution will mean that it becomes harder to earn tokens as time passes and as
        Excalibur becomes more popular. The work done by members of the community serves to maintain and increase the
        size and quality of the network.
